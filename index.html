            <h3>History of Wingback Chairs</h3>
            <p>Developed during the 1600s in England where cold weather made the roaring fireplace the gathering spot of the house, the original purpose of this stunning furnishing was to keep warm. Gaining popularity in 1720, the design was initially constructed solely from wood with flat, broad arms.</p>

            <h3>What is "koselig"?</h3>
            <p>Norwegians also have a word, koselig, that means a sense of coziness. It's like the best parts of Christmas, without all the stress. People light candles, light fires, drink warm beverages, and sit under fuzzy blankets. There's a community aspect to it too; it's not just an excuse to sit on the couch watching Netflix. Towns in Norway have plenty of festivals and community activities creating the sense that everyone was in it together.</p>
